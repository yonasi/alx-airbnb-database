# This Project Inssures The Learner to Have The Following Practical Expericances 
## 1. Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams
Learners start by creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, modeling relationships and dependencies between users, bookings, properties, and reviews in the Airbnb schema.

## 2. Complex Queries with Joins
Gain expertise in SQL joins with tasks that require combining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights. Learners explore INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN for various scenarios.

## 3. Power of Subqueries
Develop proficiency with both correlated and non-correlated subqueries. Learn how to nest queries for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filtering users based on activity thresholds.

## 4. Aggregations and Window Functions
Unlock analytical capabilities using SQL aggregation functions like COUNT and SUM. Dive into advanced window functions like ROW_NUMBER and RANK to rank and analyze data sets.

## 5. Indexing for Optimization
Learners identify performance bottlenecks and write SQL commands to create indexes for frequently queried columns. They analyze the impact of these changes on query execution times.

## 6. Query Optimization Techniques
Write and analyze complex queries for retrieving detailed information about bookings, properties, users, and payments. Refactor queries to improve execution times by reducing redundancies and leveraging indexing.

## 7. Partitioning Large Tables
Address performance challenges with large datasets by implementing table partitioning. Focus on partitioning the Booking table to improve queries on date ranges and compare performance before and after partitioning.

## 8. Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement
Learners monitor query performance using SHOW PROFILE and EXPLAIN ANALYZE, identify bottlenecks, and propose schema changes. Practical tasks include implementing these adjustments and documenting results.
